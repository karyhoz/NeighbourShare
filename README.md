# Installing Dependencies
# Navigate to the backend and frontend folders and install dependencies:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
# Running the Application
# Backend
# To start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

# Frontend
# To start the frontend server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

# Branching and Collaboration
# Creating a Branch
# Each team member should create a new branch for their work. Name your branch based on the component or feature you're working on:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
# Pushing Changes
# After committing your changes, push your branch to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

# Pull Requests
- Once your work is complete, create a pull request for your branch. Your code will be reviewed before it is merged into the main branch.

# Contribution Guidelines
* Follow the folder structure strictly.
* Ensure that your code is well-documented.
* Test your code before creating a pull request.
# Environment Variables
- Copy the .env.example file to .env and update the variables as needed.


### 6. **Set Up `.gitignore`:**
- Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude files like `node_modules`, `.env`, and others that shouldn't be tracked.

```plaintext
# Node modules
node_modules/

# Environment variables
.env

# Logs
logs/
*.log
npm-debug.log*
